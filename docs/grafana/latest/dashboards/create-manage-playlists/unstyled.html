<p>A <em>playlist</em> is a list of dashboards that are displayed in a sequence. You might use a playlist to build situational awareness or to present your metrics to your team or visitors.</p>
<p>Grafana automatically scales dashboards to any resolution, which makes them perfect for big screens.</p>
<p>You can access the <strong>Playlist</strong> feature from Grafana&rsquo;s side menu, in the Dashboards submenu.</p>
