<p>Grafana helps you collect, correlate, and visualize data with beautiful dashboards â€” the open source data visualization and monitoring solution that drives informed decisions, enhances system performance, and streamlines troubleshooting.</p>
<p>This section provides guidance to our open source community about how to build your first dashboard after you have installed Grafana. It also provides step-by-step instructions on how to add a Prometheus, InfluxDB, or an MS SQL Server data source. If you are connecting a different data source, please refer to our complete list of supported <a href="../datasources/">Data sources</a>. If you would like to learn how to get started with Grafana Cloud, our fully managed observability stack, visit the <a href="/docs/grafana-cloud/quickstart/">Grafana Cloud documentation</a> for more information.</p>
