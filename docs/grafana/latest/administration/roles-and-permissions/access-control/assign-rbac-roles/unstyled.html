<p>In this topic you&rsquo;ll learn how to use the role picker, provisioning, and the HTTP API to assign fixed and custom roles to users and teams.</p>
<h2 id="assign-fixed-roles-in-the-ui-using-the-role-picker">Assign fixed roles in the UI using the role picker</h2>
<p>This section describes how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign a fixed role to a user, team or service account as an organization administrator.</li>
<li>Assign a fixed role to a user as a server administrator. This approach enables you to assign a fixed role to a user in multiple organizations, without needing to switch organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the assignment applies only to the user, team or service account within the affected organization, and no other organizations. For example, if you grant the user the <strong>Data source editor</strong> role in the <strong>Main</strong> organization, then the user can edit data sources in the <strong>Main</strong> organization, but not in other organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Before you begin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/plan-rbac-rollout-strategy/">Plan your RBAC rollout strategy</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the fixed roles that you want to assign to the user, team or service account.</p>
<p>For more information about available fixed roles, refer to 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/rbac-fixed-basic-role-definitions/">RBAC role definitions</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that your own user account has the correct permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are assigning permissions to a user, team or service account within an organization, you must have organization administrator or server administrator permissions.</li>
<li>If you are assigning permissions to a user who belongs to multiple organizations, you must have server administrator permissions.</li>
<li>Your Grafana user can also assign fixed role if it has either the <code>fixed:roles:writer</code> fixed role assigned to the same organization to which you are assigning RBAC to a user, or a custom role with <code>users.roles:add</code> and <code>users.roles:remove</code> permissions.</li>
<li>Your own user account must have the roles you are granting. For example, if you would like to grant the <code>fixed:users:writer</code> role to a team, you must have that role yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To assign a fixed role to a user, team or service account:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sign in to Grafana.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to the organization that contains the user, team or service account.</p>
<p>For more information about switching organizations, refer to 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/administration/user-management/user-preferences/#switch-organizations">Switch organizations</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the left-side menu, click <strong>Administration</strong>, <strong>Users and access</strong>, and then <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Teams</strong>, or <strong>Service accounts</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Role</strong> column, select the fixed role that you want to assign to the user, team, or service account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Update</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To assign a fixed role as a server administrator:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Grafana as a server administrator.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Administration</strong> in the left-side menu, <strong>Users and access</strong>, and then <strong>Users</strong>.</li>
<li>Click a user.</li>
<li>In the Organizations section, click <strong>Change role</strong>.</li>
<li>Select a role within an organization that you want to assign to the user.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assign-fixed-or-custom-roles-using-the-http-api">Assign fixed or custom roles using the HTTP API</h2>
<p>This section describes how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign a fixed role to a user, team or service account as an organization administrator.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Before you begin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/plan-rbac-rollout-strategy/">Plan your RBAC rollout strategy</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the fixed roles that you want to assign to the user, team or service account.</p>
<p>For more information about available fixed roles, refer to 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/rbac-fixed-basic-role-definitions/">RBAC role definitions</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that your own user account has the correct permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are assigning permissions to a user, team or service account within an organization, you must have organization administrator or server administrator permissions.</li>
<li>If you are assigning permissions to a user who belongs to multiple organizations, you must have server administrator permissions.</li>
<li>Your Grafana user can also assign fixed role if it has either the <code>fixed:roles:writer</code> fixed role assigned to the same organization to which you are assigning RBAC to a user, or a custom role with <code>users.roles:add</code> and <code>users.roles:remove</code> permissions.</li>
<li>Your own user account must have the roles you are granting. For example, if you would like to grant the <code>fixed:users:writer</code> role to a team, you must have that role yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To assign a fixed role to a user or service account:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/access_control/#add-a-user-role-assignment">RBAC HTTP API for user role assignment</a>.</p>
<p>The service account ID can be used in place of the user ID.</p>
<p><strong>To assign a fixed role to a team:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/access_control/#add-a-team-role-assignment">RBAC HTTP API for team role assignment</a>.</p>
<h2 id="assign-fixed-or-custom-roles-to-a-team-using-provisioning">Assign fixed or custom roles to a team using provisioning</h2>
<p>Instead of using the Grafana role picker, you can use file-based provisioning to assign fixed roles to teams. If you have a large number of teams, provisioning can provide an easier approach to assigning and managing role assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Before you begin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Refer to 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/rbac-grafana-provisioning/">Role provisioning</a></li>
<li>Ensure that the team to which you are adding the fixed role exists. For more information about creating teams, refer to 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/administration/team-management/">Manage teams</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To assign a role to a team:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the YAML configuration file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refer to the following table to add attributes and values.</p>
