<p>You can deploy Grafana Enterprise in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using AWS services like ECS, EKS or EC2.</li>
<li>In an instance outside AWS.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, you must activate the Grafana Enterprise license purchased in AWS Marketplace to take advantage of Grafana Enterprise observability features. Grafana Enterprise licenses purchased through AWS Marketplace are subject to the same <a href="../#license-restrictions">restrictions</a> as Grafana Enterprise licensed purchased directly from Grafana Labs.</p>
