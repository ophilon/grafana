<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Before you begin creating and working with Grafana Teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that you have either the <code>Organization Administrator</code> role or team administrator permissions.

Recommended for <code>isolated</code> teams.</li>
<li>Viewer role - by default can view all resources. Recommended for <code>collaborative</code> teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure team sync is turned on if you plan to manage team members through team sync.
Refer to 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-team-sync/">Configure Team Sync</a> for a list of providers and instructions on how to turn on team sync for each provider.</li>

<!-- ## Create isolated or collaborative teams

Grafana Teams can either be `isolated` or `collaborative`. Isolated teams can only see their own resources. They can't see other team’s dashboards, data, or alerts. Collaborative teams have access to other team’s resources. Grafana Cloud users must contact Support.

To create an isolated team add the following to the Grafana configuration file:

```ini
auto_assign_org_role = None
role_attribute_path = contains(groups[*], 'admin') && 'Admin' || 'None'
```

To create a collaborative team add the following to the Grafana configuration file:

```ini
auto_assign_org_role = Viewer
role_attribute_path = contains(groups[*], 'admin') && 'Admin' || 'None'
```
You can also use a terraform script as shown in the following example:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    grafana = {
      source = "grafana/grafana"
    }
  }
}

provider "grafana" {
  url  = "http://localhost:3000/"
  auth = "admin:admin"
}

resource "grafana_folder" "awesome_folder" {
  title = "Awesome Team Folder"
}


resource "grafana_team" "awesome-team" {
  name  = "Awesome Team"
}

resource "grafana_team_external_group" "awesome-team-group" {
  team_id = grafana_team.awesome-team.id
  groups = [
    "Awesome_group"
  ]
}

resource "grafana_role" "team_role" {
  name  = "team_role"
  uid = "team_role"
  version = 4
  global = true

  permissions {
    action = "datasources:create"
  }

  permissions {
    action = "serviceaccounts:create"
  }

  # below should be deleted after bug fix to view service accounts
  permissions {
    action = "users.roles:read"
    scope = "users:id:*"
  }

}

resource "grafana_role_assignment" "assign_role" {
  role_uid         = grafana_role.team_role.uid
  teams            = [grafana_team.awesome-team.id]
}

resource "grafana_service_account" "awesome_service_account" {
  name        = "awesome_service_account"
  role        = "None"
  is_disabled = false
}

resource "grafana_service_account_permission" "awesome_service_account_permissions" {
  service_account_id = grafana_service_account.awesome_service_account.id

  permissions {
    team_id    = grafana_team.awesome-team.id
    permission = "Admin"
  }
}

resource "grafana_folder_permission" "awesome_folder_permission" {
  folder_uid = grafana_folder.awesome_folder.uid
  permissions {
    team_id    = grafana_team.awesome-team.id
    permission = "Admin"
  }

  permissions {
    user_id = grafana_service_account.awesome_service_account.id
    permission = "Admin"
  }
}
