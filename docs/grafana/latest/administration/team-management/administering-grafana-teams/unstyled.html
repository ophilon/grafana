<h2 id="teams-best-practices">Teams best practices</h2>
<p>Grafana recommends you use Teams to organize and manage access to Grafanaâ€™s core resources, such as dashboards and alerts. Teams is an easy organizational tool to manage, and allows flexible sharing between teams.</p>
<p>Grafana recommends that you use Instances or Stacks to separate Teams if you want true isolation, to ensure that no information leaks between Teams. You can synchronize some resources between instances using provisioning.</p>
<h2 id="secure-grafana-teams">Secure Grafana Teams</h2>
<p>The most important thing to consider for securing Teams is to only grant team administrator rights to the users you trust to administer the Team.</p>
