<li>Total admins</li>

<h3 id="counting-users">Counting users</h3>
<p>If a user belongs to several organizations, then that user is counted once as a user in the highest organization role they are assigned, regardless of how many organizations the user belongs to.</p>
<p>For example, if Sofia is a Viewer in two organizations, an Editor in two organizations, and Admin in three organizations, then she would be reflected in the stats as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total users 1</li>
<li>Total admins 1</li>
</ul>
