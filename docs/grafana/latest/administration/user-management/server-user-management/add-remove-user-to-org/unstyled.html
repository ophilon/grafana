<p>Server administrators can add and remove users in organizations. To do this as an organization administrator, see <a href="../../manage-org-users/">Manage users in an organization</a>.</p>
<h2 id="add-a-user-to-an-organization">Add a user to an organization</h2>
<p>Add a user to an organization when you want the user to have access to organization resources such as dashboards, data sources, and playlists. A user must belong to at least one organization.</p>
<p>You are required to specify an Admin role for each organization. The first user you add to an organization becomes the Admin by default. After you assign the Admin role to a user, you can add other users to an organization as either Admins, Editors, or Viewers.</p>
