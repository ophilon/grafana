<div class="admonition admonition-note"><blockquote><p class="title text-uppercase">Note</p><p>In order for the change to take effect and be reflected within the instance, the account where permissions were altered will need to sign out fully and back in. Role assignment is evaluated during sign in, so if a user has not signed back in after their role was adjusted the instance will continue to reflect their previous role.</p></blockquote></div>
