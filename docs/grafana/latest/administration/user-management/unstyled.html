<p>A <em>user</em> is defined as any individual who can log in to Grafana. Each user is associated with a <em>role</em> that includes <em>permissions</em>. Permissions determine the tasks a user can perform in the system. For example, the <strong>Admin</strong> role includes permissions for an administrator to create and delete users.</p>
