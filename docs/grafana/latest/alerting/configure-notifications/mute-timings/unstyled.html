<h1 id="configure-mute-timings-and-active-intervals">Configure mute timings and active intervals</h1>
<p>Mute timing and active time intervals let you determine how your alert notifications are handled during designated periods of time. After you create a time interval, you can apply it as either a mute or active time interval for your notifications policies.</p>
<p>A mute timing is a recurring interval that stops notifications for one or multiple notification policies during a specified period. It suppresses notifications but does not interrupt alert evaluation.</p>
<p>Use mute timings to temporarily pause notifications for a specific recurring period, such as a regular maintenance window or weekends.</p>
<p>The active time interval provide the opposite functionality, where alerts handled by a notification policy are suppressed unless the notification happens at a time that matches the time interval. Use active time intervals for periods where you want to reduce alert noise.</p>


<div class="admonition admonition-note"><blockquote><p class="title text-uppercase">Note</p><p>Mute timings and active time intervals are assigned to a 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/#alertmanager-architecture">specific Alertmanager</a> and only suppress notifications for alerts managed by that Alertmanager.</p></blockquote></div>

    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/mute-timings/">Mute and active timings</a> and 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/create-silence/">silences</a> are distinct methods to suppress notifications. They do not prevent alert rules from being evaluated or stop alert instances from appearing in the user interface; they only prevent notifications from being created.</p>
<p>The following table highlights the key differences between mute timings and silences.</p>

<h2 id="time-intervals">Time intervals</h2>
<p>A time interval is a specific duration during which alerts are suppressed. The duration typically consists of a specific time range and the days of the week, month, or year.</p>
<p>A mute or active timing can contain multiple time intervals.</p>
<p>Supported time interval options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time range: The time inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end time (in UTC if no location has been selected, otherwise local time).</li>
<li>Location: Depending on the location you select, the time range is displayed in local time.</li>
<li>Days of the week: The day or range of days of the week. Example: <code>monday:thursday</code>.</li>
<li>Days of the month: The date 1-31 of a month. Negative values can also be used to represent days that begin at the end of the month. For example: <code>-1</code> for the last day of the month.</li>
<li>Months: The months of the year in either numerical or the full calendar month. For example: <code>1, may:august</code>.</li>
<li>Years: The year or years for the interval. For example: <code>2021:2024</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All fields are lists; to match the field, at least one list element must be satisfied. Fields also support ranges using <code>:</code> (e.g., <code>monday:thursday</code>).</p>
<p>If a field is left blank, any moment of time matches the field. For an instant of time to match a complete time interval, all fields must match.</p>
<p>If you want to specify an exact duration, specify all the options.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If you wanted to create a time interval for the first Monday of the month, for March, June, September, and December, between the hours of 12:00 and 24:00 UTC your time interval specification would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time range:
<ul>
<li>Start time: <code>12:00</code></li>
<li>End time: <code>24:00</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Days of the week: <code>monday</code></li>
<li>Months: <code>3, 6, 9, 12</code></li>
<li>Days of the month: <code>1:7</code></li>
</ul>
