<p>Designing and configuring an alert management set up that works takes time. Here are some additional tips on how to create an effective alert management set up:</p>
<p><strong>Which are the key metrics for your business that you want to monitor and alert on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find events that are important to know about and not so trivial or frequent that recipients ignore them.</li>
<li>Alerts should only be created for big events that require immediate attention or intervention.</li>
<li>Consider quality over quantity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do you want to organize your alerts and notifications?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be selective about who you set to receive alerts. Consider sending them to the right teams, whoever is on call, and the specific channels.</li>
<li>Think carefully about priority and severity levels.</li>
<li>Automate as far as possible provisioning Alerting resources with the API or Terraform.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which information should you include in notifications?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider who the alert receivers and responders are.</li>
<li>Share information that helps responders identify and address potential issues.</li>
<li>Link alerts to dashboards to guide responders on which data to investigate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can you reduce alert fatigue?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid noisy, unnecessary alerts by using silences, mute timings, or pausing alert rule evaluation.</li>
<li>Continually tune your alert rules to review effectiveness. Remove alert rules to avoid duplication or ineffective alerts.</li>
<li>Continually review your thresholds and evaluation rules.</li>
</ul>
