<p>Recording rules allows you to periodically pre-compute frequently used or computationally expensive queries, saving the results as a new time series metric.</p>
<p>For instance, you can create a recording rule generating a new metric, <code>error_9001_count</code>, which counts occurrences of a specific log error within one minute. Then, query the <code>error_9001_count</code> metric in dashboards and alert rules.</p>
<p>Recording rules can be helpful in various scenarios, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster queries</strong> are needed: Performing heavy aggregations or querying large data sets is quicker with precomputed results than real-time queries.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing system load:</strong> Precomputing specific queries in advance can reduce system overload caused by multiple simultaneous queries.</li>
<li><strong>Simplifying complex aggregations:</strong> Create a new metric from complex aggregations to facilitate alert and dashboard setup.</li>
<li><strong>Reusing queries across alerts:</strong> Improve efficiency by reusing the same query across similar alert rules and dashboards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The evaluation group of the recording rule determines how often the metric is pre-computed.</p>
<p>Similar to alert rules, Grafana supports two types of recording rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/alerting-rules/create-recording-rules/create-grafana-managed-recording-rules/">Grafana-managed recording rules</a>, which can query any Grafana data source supported by alerting. It&rsquo;s the recommended option.</li>
<li>
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/alerting-rules/create-recording-rules/create-data-source-managed-recording-rules/">Data source-managed recording rules</a>, which can query Prometheus-based data sources like Mimir or Loki.</li>
</ol>
