<h2 id="manage-access-using-folders-or-data-sources">Manage access using folders or data sources</h2>
<p>You can extend the access provided by a role to alert rules and rule-specific silences by assigning permissions to individual folders or data sources.</p>


<div class="admonition admonition-note"><blockquote><p class="title text-uppercase">Note</p><p>Data source query permissions are required to create an alert rule or modify an alert rule&rsquo;s query using that data source.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>This allows different users, teams, or service accounts to have customized access to modify or silence alert rules in specific folders or using specific data sources.</p>
<p>Details on the additional access provided by folder permissions are below.</p>
