<p>A user is any individual who can log in to Grafana. Each user is associated with a role that includes permissions. Permissions determine the tasks a user can perform in the system. For example, the Admin role includes permissions for an administrator to create and delete users.</p>

<p>For Grafana OSS, there are three roles: Admin, Editor, and Viewer.</p>
<p>Details of the roles and the access they provide for Grafana Alerting are below.</p>
