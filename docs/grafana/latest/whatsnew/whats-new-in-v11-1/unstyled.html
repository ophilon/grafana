<h1 id="whats-new-in-grafana-v111">What’s new in Grafana v11.1</h1>
<p>Welcome to Grafana 11.1! This release contains some minor improvements following on the big announcements in Grafana 11.0. We&rsquo;ve adding cell text wrapping to table visualizations, a much-requested feature. We&rsquo;ve also redesigned the Alerting settings page and made it possible to manage access to Silences using role-based access control (RBAC). A number of accessibility improvements are included in this release, making Grafana easier to use for everyone. And lastly, the XY chart is now generally available.</p>

<h3 id="visualization-ease-of-use-improvements">Visualization ease of use improvements</h3>
<!-- Drew Slobodnjak, Kyle Cunningham -->
<p>We’ve made a number of small improvements to the data visualization experience in Grafana.</p>
<h4 id="table-cell-text-wrapping">Table cell text wrapping</h4>
<p><em>Available in public preview in all editions of Grafana</em></p>
<p>A longstanding feature request for the table visualization is to allow wrapping of text within cells. In Grafana 11.1 we&rsquo;ve added this capability! By default, the column with the longest text is selected for wrapping. You can also configure wrapping manually using field overrides.</p>
<p>Learn more about the table panel in our 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/table/">table panel documentation</a>.</p>

<div class="admonition admonition-note"><blockquote><p class="title text-uppercase">Note</p><p>Text wrapping is in <a href="/docs/release-life-cycle/#public-preview">public preview</a>, however, it’s available to use by default. We’d love hear from you about how this new feature is working. To provide feedback, you can open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana GitHub repository</a>.</p></blockquote></div>

<h4 id="stat-visualization-percent-change-color-mode-options">Stat visualization percent change color mode options</h4>
<p><em>Generally available in all editions of Grafana</em></p>
<p>Sometimes less is more! The <strong>Standard</strong> behavior for percent change in the 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/stat/#show-percent-change">stat visualization</a> is to color positive percent changes green and negative percent changes red. Depending on your use case however, you may want to customize how percent change color is set. We&rsquo;ve added the options to have percent change color mode <strong>Inverted</strong> (with positive red and negative green) or match the <strong>Same as value</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="xy-chart-is-ga">XY chart is GA</h3>
<!-- Leon Sorokin -->
<p><em>Generally available in all editions of Grafana</em></p>
<p>We’re promoting XY chart out of public preview and into general availability.</p>
<p>XY charts provide a way to visualize arbitrary x and y values in a graph so that you can easily show the relationship between two variables. XY charts are typically used to create scatter plots. You can also use them to create bubble charts where field values determine the size of each bubble:</p>
<p><img

  alt="An xy chart showing height weight distribution" width="2858"
     height="914"/></p>
<p>Over the past several months we’ve introduced multiple enhancements to the visualizations like auto mode, which now handles most scenarios that previously required manual configuration. Additionally, we&rsquo;ve added better control over point styling and further improved performance. We’re excited to include XY chart as a first class citizen in the core Grafana visualization library. To learn more about the panel, refer to 
    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/xy-chart/">the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>To use the new XY chart visualization, you must first enable the <code>autoMigrateXYChartPanel</code>

<h3 id="re-designed-settings-page-for-alerting">Re-designed settings page for Alerting</h3>
<!-- Gilles -->
<p><em>Generally available in all editions of Grafana</em></p>
<p>The new settings page provides you with a holistic view of where Grafana-managed alert instances are forwarded.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage which Alertmanagers receive alert instances from Grafana-managed rules without navigating and editing data sources.</li>
<li>Manage version snapshots for the built-in Alertmanager, which allows administrators to roll back unintentional changes or mistakes in the Alertmanager configuration.</li>
<li>There is also a visual diff that compares the historical snapshot with the latest configuration to see which changes were made.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Tom Ratcliffe -->
<p><em>Generally available in all editions of Grafana</em></p>
<p>Pause and resume alert rule evaluation directly from the Alert rules list and details view. This helps Improve visibility of when alert rules have been paused by displaying “Paused” as the alert rule state.</p>

    <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/manage-notifications/view-alert-rules/">alert rules documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="removes-requirement-of-datasourcesquery-permission-for-reading-rules">Removes requirement of datasources:query permission for reading rules</h3>
<!-- William Wernert -->
<p><em>Generally available in Grafana Enterprise and Cloud</em></p>
<p>Fetching a rule group no longer requires the <strong>datasources:query</strong> permission for every data source used by the rules within that group. Now, the only requirements are <strong>alert.rules:read</strong> and <strong>folders:read</strong> for the folder the group is contained in.</p>
<p>Note: <strong>datasources:query</strong> is still required to preview an alert rule, regardless of alert rules and folders permissions.</p>

<!-- Tom Ratcliffe -->
<p><em>Generally available in all editions of Grafana</em></p>
<p>More easily create silences directly from the Alert rule list view or detail page.</p>
<p>These rule-specific silences are guaranteed to only apply to a single rule and permissions to read, create, update or delete are tied to a user’s permissions for that rule.</p>
<h3 id="rule-specific-silences-with-rbac">Rule-specific silences with RBAC</h3>
<!-- Tom Ratcliffe -->
<p><em>Generally available in Grafana Enterprise and Cloud</em></p>
<p>Manage silences through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). In addition to the Grafana open source functionality in <strong>Rule-specific silences with permissions</strong>, you can choose who can create, edit, and read silences using the following permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users with the <strong>alert.silences:create permission</strong>, scoped within a folder, are able to create silences for rules contained within that folder and its subfolders</li>
<li>Users with the <strong>alert.silences:read permission</strong>, scoped within a folder, are able to read silences for rules contained within that folder and its subfolders, and general silences</li>
<li>Users with the <strong>alert.silences:write permission</strong>, scoped within a folder, are able to expire and recreate silences for rules contained within that folder and its subfolders</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-improvements">Heading improvements</h3>
<p>The majority of screen reader users <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey10/#finding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find things on a web page using headings</a>. Recently, we have added missing headings and corrected heading levels in some places, most notably panel titles.</p>
<h3 id="reduced-motion-support">Reduced motion support</h3>
<p>Users who are affected by a lot of animations on a web site have the possibility to configure <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduced motion settings</a>. Grafana now supports this, either by making animations simpler or removing them altogether. We have <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/main/packages/grafana-eslint-rules#no-unreduced-motion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implemented a rule</a>, which prohibits unhandled transitions and animations, ensuring that we can continuously support reduced motion.</p>
