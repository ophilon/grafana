<p>Welcome to Grafana 11.6! This minor release includes a number of dashboarding features that are now generally available including one-click data links and actions, Cron syntax support for annotations, and WebGL-powered geomaps for better performance. We&rsquo;ve also fully migrated from API keys to service accounts in Grafana for better security.
