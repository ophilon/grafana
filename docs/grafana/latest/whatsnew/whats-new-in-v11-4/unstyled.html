<h1 id="whats-new-in-grafana-v114">What’s new in Grafana v11.4</h1>
<p>Welcome to Grafana 11.4! This is a special release with one new feature, created in partnership with AWS. We’ve made improvements to Cloudwatch so you can query your logs using two additional query languages: Opensearch PPL and Opensearch SQL. We’ve also updated the querying experience by providing a sample of commonly-used queries, syntax highlighting in the query editor, and auto-completion suggestions for complex queries. Read on to learn more about this new feature.</p>
<p>For even more detail about all the changes in this release, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changelog</a>. For the specific steps we recommend when you upgrade to v11.4, check out our

<!-- Ida Štambuk, Zoe Chou -->
<p><em>Generally available in all editions of Grafana</em></p>
<p>The AWS CloudWatch data source plugin now offers two new query languages for searching through logs: OpenSearch PPL and OpenSearch SQL. You now have increased flexibility to choose a more familiar query language and to take advantage of their unique features (like the SQL JOIN command) when querying AWS CloudWatch Logs Insights. In addition to the already supported <strong>Logs Insights QL</strong> option, you can find the added query language options in the new <strong>Query language</strong> drop-down list.</p>

<p>We’ve also updated the query editor to support syntax highlighting and to provide suggestions while you type, which simplifies writing complex queries. When you select log groups, the suggestions also include <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_AnalyzeLogData-discoverable-fields.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discovered fields</a>.</p>
<p>Not sure where to start? We’ve also updated our <strong>CloudWatch Logs cheat sheet</strong> with the most commonly used queries so you can paste and customize to fit exactly what you need. Clicking on any of the example queries prefills the query input field.</p>
