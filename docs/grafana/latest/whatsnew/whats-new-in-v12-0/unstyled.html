<h1 id="whats-new-in-grafana-v120">What’s new in Grafana v12.0</h1>
<p>Welcome to Grafana 12.0! We have a <em>lot</em> to share. This release marks general availability for Grafana Drilldown (previously Explore Metrics, Logs, and Traces), Grafana-managed alerts and recording rules, Cloud migration, and plugin management tooling. You can also try new <a href="/docs/release-life-cycle/">preview and experimental</a> tools: Sync your dashboards directly to a GitHub repository with Git Sync, and try our new Terraform provider and CLI. Add tabs, new layouts and conditional logic to your dashboards, and load tables and geomaps far faster. Join and transform data limitlessly from multiple sources with SQL Expressions. In Grafana Cloud and Enterprise, sync your users and teams instantly from your SAML identity provider using SCIM (the System for Cross-Domain Identity Management). Lastly, don&rsquo;t forget to try on one of several new color themes for the user interface.</p>
<p>Read on to learn about these and more improvements to Grafana!</p>
